# Project Name

Infinite Scroll Blog Posts

# Project Description

Javascript project that uses a fake API to be able to test and prototype a 
project. 

# Why I Built It

I wanted to be able to show an infinite scroll in a project and see how many 
items would need to be displayed in order to initiate the scroll.

# What I Would Do Next

I would look for a real API to be display information from and see how well 
the scroll worked. I would change the look and layout depending on the API 
that was used.

# What I Learned

I learned how to display a page loader while waiting for information to be 
displayed from calling the API. I learned how to mix more than one endpoint 
into a single fetch API call.

# Stack Information

* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
* API
* Fetch

# How To Use It

Upon opening the page 5 "blog" posts are loaded for the user to see. As the 
user scrolls down the page 5 more "blog" posts are added to the page and 
continue to be added until the limit of the API has been met.
